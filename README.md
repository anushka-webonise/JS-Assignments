Added JavaScript codes as a part of completion of JavaScript training

The assignment questions are as follows :
1. Write a JavaScript code that will prompt user to enter a list of comma separated integers and returns the total occurrences of each number in an order(ascending/descending).
INPUT: 5,4,2,8,2,1,4,5,8,5,2,8,8,8
OUTPUT: 1: 1
2: 3
4: 2
5: 2
8: 5


2. Create a simple JavaScript Calculator application with two input fields and two buttons (addition and subtraction). User will input the two numbers and click any of the button, it should display answer in the document below that. Handle all the cases of incorrect input
parameters.
INPUT 1: 6 INPUT 2: 5
Click => ADDITION
The sum is 11
INPUT 1: 6 INPUT 2: 5
Click => SUBTRACTION
The difference is 1


3. Write a JavaScript code that starts to execute on a button click and will open a particular url in multiple new tabs (say 5) and close them after a certain interval recursively. The script should stop its execution onclick of another button on the same page.


4. Create a simple form that will accept name and email of a user and onsubmit, stores the details with the current timestamp. User can add multiple name and email sets. There should be a button “SHOW USERS” which will list all the name and email sets with their timestamp in the document. Form should be validated before submission else it should show an error. (Expected session handling for this)
Name: can accept character or numbers
Email: can accept a genuine email only.
